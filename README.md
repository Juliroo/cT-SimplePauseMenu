We are pleased to introduce our new script! We have decided to go for something simple and that won't take us more than 10 minutes, as we have seen that there are many people selling this kind of PauseMenu without any information or anything out of the ordinary!

## Key Features:

**Sounds**: 🔊 The script features clean sounds in the interface.  
**Animations**: 📦 The script features smooth and nice animations.

## New Enhancements:

-   **Configurable Translations**: Now there is a configurable `config.lua` file where you can change the translation in `Config.Locale` or create/edit your own translations.
-   **No Dependencies**: The script no longer requires any external dependencies.
-   **Vue 3 Integration**: The script has been fully migrated to Vue 3, and all code has been refactored and cleaned up.
